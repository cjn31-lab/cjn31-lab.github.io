        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>I started doing theater when I signed up for the drama elective at my middle school in <i>Cooper City, Florida</i>. I stuck with it, but didn't really gain the passion for it until I was in high school doing a professional production of The
            Little
            Mermaid. No one told me the theater bugs bite was permanent.I am currently a senior BFA Musical Theater student at the University of Miami. After graduating, the plan is to move wherever the work takes me to start my life as a professional
            actor. </p>


        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I love <i>wild</i> animals (the more dangerous <b>the better</b>). 
            <li> My dream job as a kid was to be a cowboy. Yeehaw!
            <li> I can rap really fast.
            <li>I currently have a song of my own on Spotify titled <b>"The Forest"</b> and another song that I co-wrote titled <b>"Love You (Some You)"</b>that has over 3,000 streams across all platforms."
